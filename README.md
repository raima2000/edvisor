# Learning Management System

## Goals
As a team of software developers whose academic activities are also affected by the current
platform, we have taken a genuine interest in improvement and expansion of the system.
This project aims to build a new cloud-based LMS that is:
- Easy to maintain: Minimized redundancy, concise and comprehensible coding
standards, detailed documentation.
- User-friendly: Aesthetically pleasing interface, purposeful combination of layout,
colors and typography to simplify and enhance user experience.
- All-encompassing: Including more diverse management tools, assessment, analytics
and user feedback.

## Software Architecture
This system implements a three-layer architecture:
- Top tier: Consists of a user interface that displays data and a communication layer
that collects data which can be accessed through a GUI. It is also where end users
can interact with the software in a variety of ways.
- Middle tier: Data from the top level is processed and transformed to give operable
information, which can then be used to modify the bottom tier. It acts as a bridge
for communication between the top and bottom level.
- Bottom tier: Data storage layer which is implemented by using a database
management system.
